## Configuring S3 as an Artifact Source

If you want to use a file from S3 in your pipeline,
you'll need to configure S3 as an artifact source.  This is how you would,
for example, reference a Helm chart tarball for later use during
deployment.

This is just a quick walkthrough of how to configure your Spinnaker to access
an S3 bucket as a source of artifacts.  Many of the configurations below have
additional options that may be useful (or possibly required).  If you need
more detailed help, take a look at the
[Halyard command reference](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-artifact-s3-account)

### Enable S3 Artifacts

If you haven't done this yet (for example, if you've just installed Armory
Spinnaker fresh), you'll need to enable S3 as an artifact source:

* **Operator**

    Add the following snippet to `SpinnakerService` manifest:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{ site.data.versions.operator-extended-crd-version }}
    kind: SpinnakerService
    metadata:
      name: spinnaker
    spec:
      spinnakerConfig:  
        config:
          features:
            artifacts: true
          artifacts:
            s3:
              enabled: true
    ```

* **Halyard**

    ```bash
    hal config features edit --artifacts true
    hal config artifact s3 enable
    ```

### Add S3 Account

You only need to configure the S3 credentials as an account -- all buckets
that account has access to can be referenced after that.

* **Operator**

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/{{ site.data.versions.operator-extended-crd-version }}
    kind: SpinnakerService
    metadata:
      name: spinnaker
    spec:
      spinnakerConfig:  
        config:
          features:
            artifacts: true
          artifacts:
            s3:
              enabled: true
              accounts:
              - name: my-s3-account
                region: us-west-2 # S3 region
                awsAccessKeyId: ABCDEF01234... # Your AWS Access Key ID. If not provided, Spinnaker will try to find AWS credentials as described at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default
                awsSecretAccessKey: abc        # Your AWS Secret Key. This field supports "encrypted" secret references (https://docs.armory.io/spinnaker-install-admin-guides/secrets/)
    ```

* **Halyard**

    ```bash
    hal config artifact s3 account add my-s3-account \
        --region us-west-2 \
        --aws-access-key-id ABCDEF01234... \
        --aws-secret-access-key # Will be prompted for this interactively
    ```

    > NOTE:  If you are running Armory 2.1.x or earlier, the AWS secrets configured
    > with halyard above will not work as-is; you'll want to create/edit the file
    > `~/.hal/default/service-settings/clouddriver.yml` and add the credentials as
    > environment variables:
    ```yaml
    env:
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ABCDEF01234....
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: LXabcdef012345...
    ```

Detailed information on all command line options can be found [here](https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/halyard/commands/#hal-config-artifact-s3-account-add)

Apply your changes with `kubectl -n <spinnaker namespace> apply -f <SpinnakerService manifest>` if using the Operator, or `hal deploy apply` if using Halyard.
